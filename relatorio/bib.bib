  abstract = {This paper presents an academic web community, MathOverflow, as a network. Social network analysis is used to examine the interactions among users over a period of two and a half years.We describe relevant aspects associated with its behaviour as a result of the dynamics arisen from users participation and contribution, such as the existence of clusters, rich--club and collaborative properties within the network.We examine, in particular, the relationship between the social achievements obtained by users and node centrality derived from interactions through posting questions, answers and comments. Our study shows that the two aspects have a strong direct correlation; and active participation in the forum seems to be the most effective way to gain social recognition.},
